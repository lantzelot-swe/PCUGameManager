	"When editing a game and editing the Game Tile, Year, Author, Composer and Description if you want to edit a word or number it allows you to do one character then the cursor(|) jumps to the end of the line or end of the description.
	Like the Year ..
	1999
	so put cursor here..  (|) cursor
	199|9
	to change it to 1989 when you press backspace to delete 9 then it says..
	199
	and then the cursor end up after the number..
	199|
	so if you press 8 to make it say 1989 it then says..
	1998|
	the cursor should be here..
	19|9
	The cursor should stay were you put it not jump to the end of the line."

	"You can't edit the Game Title if the game is in the PCUGM already..? I wanted to change the games name "Great court" cause "court" is meant to be "Court" not "court", it needs a capital C, its saying name it a different name, I know it sounds a bit silly but I thought I report it anyway.. :)"
