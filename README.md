# PCU Game Manager
PCU (Project Carousel USB) Game Manager is a tool for managing games and game information used by the games carousel for TheC64, TheVic20 and the TheC64 Mini.

To run the PCU game manager you first need a "full version" that includes a JRE, you can get it from this post: [pcu-game-manager-released](https://thec64community.online/thread/603/pcu-game-manager-released?page=1), here is the direct download folder: [spannernicks onedrive](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21ABk%2DxxKnx%2DBeuIo&id=DE6843E1C82A96C8%2148803&cid=DE6843E1C82A96C8)

When you have that you can just download the latest exe from [here](https://github.com/lantzelot-swe/PCUGameManager/releases/latest) and replace it to run the latest version. There is also a built-in version check in the help menu which will point you to the latest relase.
