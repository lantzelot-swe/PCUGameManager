# PCUAE Manager
PCUAE (Project Carousel USB Anniversary Edition) Manager is a tool for managing games and game information used by the games carousel for TheC64, TheVic20 and the TheC64 Mini.

To run the PCUAE Manager you first need a "full version" that includes a JRE, you can get it from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_F1MGrP5Z5qMEiOOWTkTEkUwVA_A1c42?usp=sharing).

The manager will check for new versions when started. Updates can be downloaded and installed automatically. It will also check for new versions of PCUAE when installing to a USB drive from the manager.
