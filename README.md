# PCU Game Manager
PCU (Project Carousel USB) Game Manager is a tool for managing games and game information used by the games carousel for TheC64, TheVic20 and the TheC64 Mini.

To run the PCU game manager you first need a "full version" that includes a JRE, you can get it from this [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_F1MGrP5Z5qMEiOOWTkTEkUwVA_A1c42?usp=sharing).

When you have that you can just download the latest exe from [here](https://github.com/lantzelot-swe/PCUGameManager/releases/latest) and replace it to run the latest version. There is also a built-in version check in the help menu which will point you to the latest relase.
